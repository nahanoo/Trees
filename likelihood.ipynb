    "To make it a bit more explicit, I’m explaining in more details here the step 2 of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create your tree from the three files, the only nodes having information about the data are the tips (terminal nodes). This is because we do have data for them in the form of sequences in the alignment. The internal nodes are not observed and we do not know the sequence that they could hold. The main goal of the algorithm is to take into account the uncertainty in the values of the internal nodes to get an estimate of the tree likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm to calculate the likelihoods will start from the data at each tip and we will assume that each site in the msa is independent. We can thus calculate the likelihood of a single site at a time. The full likelihood of a msa will be the product of the likelihoods at each site.\n",
    "\n",
    "As said before, at the internal nodes, we do not observe any data. There is thus an uncertainty on whether the node has the nucleotide $A$, $C$, $G$ or $T$ at site $s$. To take this into account, we need to calculate a vector of likelihood at each node for the site $s$. The vector has 4 elements, which are the likelihoods to oberved $A$, $C$, $G$ or $T$ at that node. We call these vectors conditional likelihoods, because for internal nodes, the values are conditional on the data that is present in the two nodes directly descending from the one we are looking at. At the terminal nodes, we do observe the data. For example, say that sequence 1 has a $A$ for the site $s$. We will encode this into a vector format too, to make it compatible with what we use for internal nodes. Therefore, the data $A$ will be coded as `[1,0,0,0]`. We are certain to see $A$ at this site, because it is in the data itself. We usually keep the order $A$, $C$, $G$, $T$ for the four elements of each of these vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we have a simple tree with two terminal nodes and one internal node. Let's try to estimate the likelihood on this simplified example to make it clear. Assume that the `species1` has a $A$ and `species2` has a $C$. The data is the following (i.e. a list in Python):"

To do so, we need another element, which is a model of evolution, to tell us the probabilities of changing into a $A$ in `species1` and a $C$ in `species2` given an unknown nucleotide $X$ in the ancestor. This is done by setting a transition matrix $Q$ of size $4 \\times 4$, with rows representing the starting nucleotide and columns the ending nucleotide. We need to combine this model of evolution with the amount of evolution between two nodes (express by the branch lengths) to get a probability matrix $P$ of having a certain nucleotide at the end of the branch if we have a certain nucleotide at the beginning of it.

The matrix $Q$ is then scaled by the total amount of change to have the total rate of change being 1 (not directly obvious from $Q$, but trust me). The scaling is important because the $Q$ matrix appears as a product with the branch length to obtain the probabilities of change. Scaling $Q$ means that the branch length is the parameter reflecting the amount of change.

These numbers do not sum up to one, because it is the conditional probability of observing the nucleotides given the branch lengths and the data in the two species. We could therefore have many more ways to get the probabilities that we do not cover with this specific tree, branch lengths and model. However, it makes sense that the probability of $A$ is higher than $C$ because the branch length $t_1$ is smaller than $t_2$. There is thus less evolution leading to the $A$ than to the $C$, which implies that the ancestor is slighly more probable to have a $A$. Nice, no?
